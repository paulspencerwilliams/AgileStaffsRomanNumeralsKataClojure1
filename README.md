# Agile Staffs Roman Numerals Kata in Clojure 

Before [Thursday's Agile Staffs
session](http://www.meetup.com/Agile-Staffordshire/events/218889499), I made a
promise to myself; whichever kata I chose, I would do it in Clojure. However as
I started pairing with Mike, a relatively new first year student, I thought a
language as initially mind bending as Clojure combined with introductions to
TDD and Git might be step too far. We thus explored the [Roman Numerals Kata in
Java](https://github.com/paulspencerwilliams/AgileStaffsRomanNumeralsKataJava1). 

To fulfil my promise to myself, I pretty much completed the kata during
yesterday's lunch break. As I succeeded in completing the challenge, I did
remove a couple of invalid acceptance tests I discovered and I did a little
refactoring today to make the code more readable.  

# Approach

Initially, I did simple triangulation to get a basic approach which I knew
wouldn't be sufficiently extensible to complete the whole problem. However,
during this, I discovered an approach by converting each character to it's
numeric value, and reversing through this sequence whilst keeping a register of
the highest value I'd found to that point. For each value, I would sum or
reduce the total dependant on whether the value was smaller or larger than the
register. This would handle situations like IV where I reduces the value 5 by
1, rather than adding.

After a little play with this approach in the REPL, I implemented all the
acceptance tests from the challenge, and implemented the new approach in one
go.
